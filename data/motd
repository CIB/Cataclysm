Welcome to 2012, roguelike fans!
I was away on vacation for a few weeks, so excuse my absence and
the small-ish update.  This update focuses on a new mutation
system.  It now works on a tech tree of sorts; one mutation can
lead to another, some mutations cancel each other, and mutations
are grouped into types; tree-like or fish-like, for example.
Mutating inside a type increases your chances of mutating in
that type in the future.
There's also some rebalance tweaks here; most notably, the XP
pool is capped rather low, and shooting at fast-moving monsters
is harder.
